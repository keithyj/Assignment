# Executive summary

* In this report, we are analysing the cancer dataset (2013) in US counties which we note is incomplete and we have treated any missing as well as abnormal observations from the data. 
* We notice that there is an exhaustive amount of factors used to predict cancer death rate in US counties and therefore, we suggest that we can omit some predictor variables to reduce complexity of our analysis. 
* We finally acknowledge that our dataset needs to be further curated, transformed and investigated before fitting our model.
