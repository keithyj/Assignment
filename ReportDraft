### Executive Summary (3 bullet points max)

### Introduction

### Findings (2 pages max)
**** Which variables show a strong relationship with the outcome variable? ◦ Can the relationship be characterized as a linear?
◦ Does the relationship appear to be homoscedastic?
◦ Are any transformations, required? If so which ones?
### Statistical Methodology
**** What issues did we identify in the initial EDA? How will these impact on modelling decisions when you come to build your statistical model?
******** Missing values
-- Can you suggest a mechanism for missing data (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)?
-- What should be done with missing values when you come to build your statistical model?
******** Skewness
-- Which variables, if any, have a highly skewed distribution? What transformations might be applied to reduce skewness and stabilize the spread of the observations? (This might be different to transformations required to make the relationship linear/homoscedastic with the dependent variable)
******** Outliers
-- Do any of the variables have outlying values? How should outliers be treated?
******** Univariate
-- Which variables are highly correlated with each other? Are there variables that represent different
ways of measuring the same thing?
******** Heteroscedacity
******** Bivariate
******** Heteroscedacity
******** Multivariate
******** Heteroscedacity
**** Did we transform any of the variables? Why or why not?
******** Heteroscedacity
******** 
**** Can we exclude any of the variables from the model building process? Why or why not?
******** Multicollinearity

-- Given all of the above, what recommendations would you suggest for preparing these data in order
to fit a linear model?
