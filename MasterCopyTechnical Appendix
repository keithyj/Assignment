## Executive Summary


## Key Findings


## Statistical Methodology
### Introduction

This report examines how death rate (due to cancer) differ across US counties and possibly relate to different factors such as incidence rate, income, poverty, employment, education, private or public coverage. Also, we attempt to check if death rate varies amongst males, females, Black community and married individuals.
We will explore which variables show a strong relationship with the death rate and answer using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the distribution of the variables and the relationships between them. Ultimately, answering whether the model assumptions are met - allowing us to, in future, build a statistical model.
Some EDA techniques we will use are: observing if any heteroscedacity exists, observing if the relationships are linear, identify any outliers and missing values, observing the skew of relationships, and determining if any transformations are required.


### Summary

First lets have a look at a summary of all the data:

```{r summary, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
summary(cancer)
cancer1 <- cancer
susPoint <- which(cancer1$AvgHouseholdSize < 0.5)
cancer1$AvgHouseholdSize[susPoint] <- NA
summary(cancer1)
DF<-cancer[,c(5, 12:14)]
```
### Missing Values and Strange Values:

```{r}
load("cancer.rdata")
summary(cancer)
```

There are some missing values in PctEmployed16_Over which need to be checked.
Before that is checked though we should note that the outliers in AvgHouseholdSize should be treated as missing values as they are wrongly inputted (reference).

```{r}
cancer1 <- cancer
cancer1$AvgHouseholdSize[cancer1$AvgHouseholdSize < 0.5] <- NA
```

Now I use the VIM package and the pbox() function to show that the missing data are all MCAR and can thus be easily dealt with.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(VIM)
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
for(i in 2:5){
  pbox(cancer1, pos = i)
}
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
for(i in 6:9){
  pbox(cancer1, pos = i)
}
```


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,4))
for(i in 10:13){
  pbox(cancer1, pos = i)
}
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,5))
for(i in 14:18){
  pbox(cancer1, pos = i)
}
```

From the pbox plots we have evidence that the missing values interrogated are MCAR. Since the proportion of rows with missing values is small I recommend simply deleting the rows with missing values as it should not affect the validity of our analysis on the whole dataset as the smaller sample is still representative.

```{r}
cancer2 <- na.omit(cancer1)
```

Our other option is to use the reference to fill in all our other missing values. Despite this being possible it is also un-necessary as the data is MCAR and won't significantly affect our analysis.

We notice that there is one categorical variable (binnedInc) and one ID variable (Geography). Geography shouldn't be used as an explanatory variable but could be used as a visual aid.

We also note that PctEmployed16_Over has 152 missing values that should be investigated.

### Comparing Predictors and Response

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

ggpairs(cancer2, columns = c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18), mapping = aes(alpha = 0.6),
        upper = list(continuous=wrap("cor", size=2.5, digits=2, stars=FALSE)),
        lower = list(continuous=wrap("points", size = 0.5)),
        diag = list(continuous="densityDiag"),
        progress = FALSE) +
  theme(text=element_text(size=6))
  
plot_correlate(cancer2)
  
#medIncome is right skewed, can do a transformation on this
#MedianAgeFemale and MedianAgeMale are heavily positively correlated
#No clue what is happening with the binned income might be worth doing this plot without binned income and doing that as a seperate thing to then do the correlaiton as it is hard to see the intervals
#Death rate and median age has almost no correlation.
#Variance inflation factors to look at binnedincome and median income - if high, multicollinearity exists and we can argue to get rid of it.

#povertyPercent, PctPrivateCoverage, PctEmpCoverage, PctPublicCoverage: The three coverage variables are highly correlated as expected. However, the deathRate is not significantly correlated to any of the coverage variables.
#The correlation coefficicent between deathRate and the coverage variables do not exceed 0.45.

# Unemployed and Employed 16 or over have high correlation with each other.

# PercentMarried and PctMarriedHouseholds are also highly correlated. 

```
We can see initially that medIncome is right skewed, also median age Male and Female are highly correlated. We will use a pearsons coefficient to check if multicollinearity exist (http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-test-between-two-variables-in-r). 
binnedInc does not tell us much from this graph - we will instead look at binnedInc and medIncome together as they measure similar data to check for multicollinearity. 

```{r incomes}
mod_points=function(data,mapping,...) {
  ggally_smooth_loess(data, mapping,pch=20, ...) +
    theme(text = element_text(size=8))
}  
mod_cor=function(data,mapping,...) {
  ggally_cor(data, mapping,size=1.5,align_percent=0.9, digits = 2) + scale_colour_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),...)
}
ggpairs(cancer2, columns = c(3,4), mapping = aes(alpha = 0.6),
        upper = list(continuous=mod_cor),
        lower = list(continuous=wrap(mod_points, col = "red")),
        diag = list(continuous="densityDiag"),
        progress = FALSE) +
        theme(text=element_text(size=6))
```

We can observe that for the first 9 bins medIncome and binnedInc show very similar results. We will therefore consider only using medIncome in our model.

``` {r pearson test}
cor.test(cancer2$MedianAgeMale, cancer2$MedianAgeFemale, method = c("pearson"))
```
As the p value is below 0.05 we can assume the correlation is significant and multicollinearity exists between the Median age Male and Median age Female.



### Univariate Plots:

```{r uni, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(cancer$AvgHouseholdSize)
hist(cancer$PctEmployed16_Over)
hist(cancer$PctBlack)
hist(cancer$PctUnemployed16_Over)
DF %>% gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free") +
  geom_histogram(col = c("blue"), fill = "blue", alpha=0.6)
hist(cancer2$medIncome)
hist(cancer2$MedianAgeFemale)
hist(cancer2$MedianAgeMale)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(cancer2$incidenceRate, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Incidence Rate")
plot(density(cancer2$incidenceRate), main= "Density estimate of Incidence Rate") 

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(cancer2$PercentMarried, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Percent Married")
plot(density(cancer2$PercentMarried), main="Density estimate of Percent Married") 

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(cancer2$PctMarriedHouseholds, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of PctMarriedHouseholds")
plot(density(cancer2$PctMarriedHouseholds), main="Density estimate of PctMarriedHouseholds")

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(cancer2$Edu18_24, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Edu18_24")
plot(density(cancer2$Edu18_24), main="Density estimate of Edu18_24")
# We note that incidence rate shows a severe postive skew. 
# We need to fix the skewness by considering a possible logarithmic transformation. 
# PercentMarried also shows moderate negative skewness. We can fix this using square transformation for negatively skewed data.

#medIncome seem to have a right skew, more skew than any others.
# We note that PctBlack has very large right skew and will need transforming to fix this.
# We also note that there are some very suspicious low values in AvgHouseholdSize which are outliers. We create a new dataset containing these suspicious values.
# We can see that the three Coverage variables are symmetrical but povertyPercent is right-skewed.
# A transformation is needed to tackle this skewness.
```

```{r Plots against deathRate}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
with(cancer2, scatter.smooth(deathRate~medIncome, col = "red"))
with(cancer2, scatter.smooth(deathRate~MedianAgeFemale, col = "red"))
with(cancer2, scatter.smooth(deathRate~MedianAgeMale, col = "red"))
with(cancer2, scatter.smooth(deathRate~binnedInc, col = "red"))
```

There is definite heteroscedasticity in medIncome and for both MedianAgeFemale and MedianAgeMale we see some non linearity. We see a concave shape so advising a more compex model, perhaps with a quadratic term might be advisable as the data is not monotonic. We could also consider combining the two variables by taking an average as their relationship with Death Rate are very similar. BinnedInc does not show us much other than it is linear.

From the scatter plots there are no clear outliers.

```{r historgrams for skew}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
with(cancer2, hist(medIncome))
with(cancer2, hist(MedianAgeFemale))
with(cancer2, hist(MedianAgeMale))
```

Massive right skew for medIncome. Median age Male and Female seem to have a pretty symettrical skew.
I recommend a log transform for medIncome.

```{r Transforms}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
hist(log(cancer2$medIncome), main = "Transformed medIncome")
```

There still exists a slight right skew but it is an improvement.


### HETEROSCEDASTICITY

### TESTING HETEROSCEDACITY


### Multicolinearity


### OUTLIERS
First we use box-plots to see if there are any suspicous value.
```{r outlier, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(cancer2, aes(medIncome)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(MedianAgeMale)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(MedianAgeFemale)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(binnedInc)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(PctBlack)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(AvgHouseholdSize)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(PctUnemployed16_Over)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(PctEmployed16_Over)) + geom_boxplot()
```
```{r boxplot, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

DF %>% gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) + facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free") +
  geom_boxplot(shape=1, alpha=0.3)
# From the box-plots, all four variables have a quite a big number of extreme values. We need further investigations.
```


```{r outliers, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(cancer2, aes(incidenceRate)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(PercentMarried)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2,aes(PctMarriedHouseholds)) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(cancer2, aes(Edu18_24)) + geom_boxplot()

# We observe that the  outliers are present for all predictor variables. 

# The boxplot for Incidence rate shows the existence of extreme high values. 

# Therefore, we might want to investigate into the outliers of incidence rate only and decide how we might want to treat them. 

# Possible options include deleting the outliers or imputing them. 

# This might depend on whether the outlier is due to some error (data entry, sampling, measurement) or whether the outlier is natural. 
```
```{r BoxPlots}
par(mfrow = c(2,3))
with(cancer2, boxplot(medIncome, main = "medIncome"))
with(cancer2, boxplot(MedianAgeFemale, main = "MedianAgeFemale"))
with(cancer2, boxplot(MedianAgeMale, main = "MedianAgeMale"))
with(cancer2, boxplot(binnedInc, main = "binnedInc"))

```
Our box plots show we have quite a number of what we would consider outliers accross all our variables apart from binnedInc, which would be impossible due to the bins intervals. This does not necessarily mean that they should be removed as we do not know their influence yet due to not fitting a model.

We have a severe amount of outliers in medIncome. This is most likely due to natural causes such as a CEO of a large company or a doctor (Reference needed about high paid jobs). 


### Transformation in Skew
```{r fix skew, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Try cube rooting for poverty.
DF$povertyFIX <- (DF$povertyPercent)^(1/3)
ggplot(DF, aes(povertyFIX))+geom_density()
```

```{r fix skew, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Try log for medincome.
cancer2$medIncomeFix <- log(cancer2$medIncome)
ggplot(cancer2, aes(medIncomeFix))+geom_density()
```

```{r Fixing Black, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# PctBlack is incredibly right skewed, we can try a log transformation to fix it. 
cancer2$blackFix <- log(cancer2$PctBlack)
ggplot(cancer2, aes(blackFix)) + geom_density()
```

```{r Fix Unemployment, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# PctUnemployed16_Over is also slightly right skewed. We can try a square root transformation to fix this.
cancer2$UnempFix <- sqrt(cancer2$PctUnemployed16_Over)
ggplot(cancer2, aes(UnempFix)) + geom_density()
```

```{r Size Fix, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Average household size maybe needs fixing
cancer2$Avgfix <- log(cancer2$AvgHouseholdSize)
ggplot(cancer2, aes(Avgfix)) + geom_density()
```

```{r transformation, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Try fixing incidence rate and percent married
cancer2$incidenceRate <- log(cancer2$incidenceRate)
hist(cancer2$incidenceRate, main = "Histogram of Transformed Incidence Rate")
plot(density(cancer2$incidenceRate), main= "Density estimate of Transformed Incidence Rate")

cancer2$PercentMarried<- cancer2$PercentMarried^(2)
hist(cancer2$PercentMarried, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of transformed Percent Married")
plot(density(cancer2$PercentMarried), main="Density estimate of transformed Percent Married")
# The transformed predictor variables, ie, Incidence Rate and PercentMarried, now have a normal spread and therefore skewness is fixed.
```


We have evidence of multicolinearity between Unemployment and Employment.

### FIXING HETEROSCEDASCITY













### 1. LOOKING AT DEATH RATE IN THE USA
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
cancer3 <- cancer
uwu2 <- str_split(cancer3$Geography, pattern = ", ")
cancer3$state <- rep(0, length(cancer3$Geography))
for(i in 1:length(cancer3$Geography)){
  cancer3$state[i] <- uwu2[[i]][2]
}
cancer3$county <- rep(0, length(cancer3$Geography))
for(i in 1:length(cancer3$Geography)){
  cancer3$county[i] <- uwu2[[i]][1]
}
cancer3$county[167] <- "Dona Ana County"
cancer3$county[821] <- "La Salle Parish"
cancer3$fips <- rep("0", length(cancer3$Geography))
for(i in 1:length(cancer3$Geography)){
  cancer3$fips[i] <- fips(cancer3$state[i], cancer3$county[i])
}
deathMap <- subset(cancer3, select = c("fips", "county", "deathRate"))
plot_usmap(data = deathMap,regions = "counties", values = "deathRate", include = cancer3$fips, color = "red") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "yellow", high = "red", name = "Death Rate", label = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Death rates in the states") +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

The map above gives a nice illustration of what death rate looks like accross the United States, whites indicate that county was missing from the original dataset.


```{r strange, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sus <- subset(cancer, AvgHouseholdSize < 0.5)
head(sus)
```

I will use an alternate source to check if the AvgHousehold Size is correct for Berkeley County.

```{r Berk, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sus[1,"AvgHouseholdSize"]
```

Reference:
https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=average%20household%20size&g=0500000US54003&y=2013&tid=ACSST1Y2013.S1101

From the same census data we have that the average household size of this county is 2.61. This indicates the data has been incorrectly 
inputted into this dataset or the data is missing. Either way, this incorrect data could cause the distribution to be unstable and should be considered as missing.


```
