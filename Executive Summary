- Key points from our EDA: not full number of US counties recorded in our dataset; missing and suspicious values filtered out;we note high correlation between predictor variables; no strong relationship between death rate and other explanatory variables.Some predictors measure the similar things in different ways.
- required variables in modelling cancer deathrates in US counties:
Geography, incidence rate, medincome, povertyPercent, AvgHouseholdsize, PercentMarried, PctEmployed16_Over, PctUnemployed16_over, PctPublicCoverage, PctBlack, Edu18_24. -- To check
