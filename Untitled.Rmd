```

## Univariate
First need to figure out how to cope with binnedInc (DEAL WITH THIS AFTER, GET EVERYONES OPINIONS)
``` {r}
class(cancer2$binnedInc)
#Factor
```

```{r 1}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(cancer2$medIncome)
hist(cancer2$MedianAgeFemale)
hist(cancer2$MedianAgeMale)

#medIncome seem to have a right skew, more skew than any others.
```

```{r 2}
JamesCancer <- cancer2 %>% select("Geography", "medIncome", "MedianAgeMale", "MedianAgeFemale", "binnedInc", "deathRate")
summary(JamesCancer)
count(JamesCancer, medIncome == "")
count(JamesCancer, MedianAgeMale == "")
count(JamesCancer, MedianAgeFemale == "")
count(JamesCancer, binnedInc == "")
count(JamesCancer, medIncome == "NA")
count(JamesCancer, MedianAgeMale == "NA")
count(JamesCancer, MedianAgeFemale == "NA")
count(JamesCancer, binnedInc == "NA")
#Doesn't appear to be any missing data or values
```

```{r 3}
#comparison of predictors and response
library(GGally)
ggpairs(JamesCancer, columns = c("medIncome", "MedianAgeMale", "MedianAgeFemale", "binnedInc", "deathRate"), mapping = aes(alpha = 0.6),
        upper = list(continuous=wrap("cor", size=2.5, digits=2, stars=FALSE)),
        lower = list(continuous=wrap("points", size = 0.5)),
        diag = list(continuous="densityDiag"),
        progress = FALSE) +
  theme(text=element_text(size=6))

#medIncome is right skewed, can do a transformation on this
#MedianAgeFemale and MedianAgeMale are heavily positively correlated
#No clue what is happening with the binned income ðŸ˜‚ might be worth doing this plot without binned income and doing that as a seperate thing to then do the correlaiton as it is hard to see the intervals
#Death rate and median age has almost no correlation.
#Variance inflation factors to look at binnedincome and median income - if high, multicollinearity exists and we can argue to get rid of it.
```

``` {r 4}
#Look at residuals vs fitted to see if non-linear and any signs of heteroscedascity
modIncome <- lm(deathRate~medIncome, data = JamesCancer)
modMale <- lm(deathRate~MedianAgeMale, data = JamesCancer)
modFemale <- lm(deathRate~MedianAgeFemale, data = JamesCancer)
modbinnedInc <- lm(deathRate~binnedInc, data = JamesCancer)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(modIncome, 1)
plot(modMale, 1)
plot(modFemale, 1)
plot(modbinnedInc, 1)

#Kinda have a heteroscedasicity for medIncome, no signs for the others.
#Need to deal with heteroscaedscatic, use a spread level plot
```

``` {r 5}
ncvTest(lm(deathRate~medIncome, data = JamesCancer))
#Heteroscedastic
```

```{r outliers}
outlierTest(modIncome)
outlierTest(modMale)
outlierTest(modFemale)
outlierTest(modbinnedInc)
```

``` {r multicollinearity}
vif(lm(deathRate~binnedInc + medIncome, data = cancer2))
```
